Cloth Simulator
In this project, I implement a cloth simulator using mass and spring system. I firstly add point masses to a point_mass vector and then add three springs types between two point masses to spring vectors. Next, I implement the collision simulation between cloth and other objects and itself. I also implement shaders for the cloth. After this project, I am able to translate physics to codes.
